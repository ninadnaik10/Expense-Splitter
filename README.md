## How does it work?
Suppose there are 3 people A, B, C and they are spending money together.
Let's say they spend 35 bucks for tickets, 45 bucks for food and 10 bucks for drinks (assuming everyone's share is equal).
A gives out 30, B gives out 50 and C gives out 10. Share of each person is 30 bucks. To equalize it, C should give 5 bucks to A, and 10 bucks to B.
This app will help you calculate the same!
